    <comment>Archived project. We had this in WTP builds for a
        long time, and then discovered no one used it. Apparently an
        earlier test plugin. To make obvious this is not an active
        plugin, I've "nulled out" head. I tagged the "last used" HEAD
        version with v20081210Final in case it ever needs to be
        restored.</comment>
