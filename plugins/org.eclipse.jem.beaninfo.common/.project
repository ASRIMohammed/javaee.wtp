	<comment>Considered archived version. As far as we know, this bundle was never used in a release, but 
    to play it safe, will just null out HEAD, and leave the rest in CVS as is. The final version in HEAD 
    was versioned with v20081211FinalVersion in case it's ever discovered this needs to be reinstantiated in HEAD.
    Note org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo.vm and org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo.vm.common basically do what this was attempting to do, I believe.
