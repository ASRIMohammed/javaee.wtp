<h1 class="topictitle1">Exporting EJB projects to EJB JAR files</h1>
<div><p>After you have tested your enterprise beans, you can export the
module into an EJB JAR file.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>When you export an EJB module, or project, the contents of the
project are exported into an EJB JAR file regardless of whether deployment
code has been generated or not. You can use the exported server-side JAR file
as the client JAR file, since it contains all of the required code from both
a server-side and client-side perspective.</p>
<div class="important" id="teexp__exportEJBClientJAR"><a name="teexp__exportEJBClientJAR"><!-- --></a><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span>If
you use the Export EJB JAR file wizard to export an EJB project, the export
wizard does not include an EJB project's associated EJB client JAR project.
To include the EJB client JAR file, it is recommended that you export the
enterprise application EAR file that contains the EJB project. The resulting
EAR file will include any dependent EJB client JAR files as utility JAR files.
Alternatively, you can <a href="teclientjarremove.html">remove the EJB
client JAR file</a> before exporting the EJB project, or export the EJB
client JAR project separately as a JAR file. Another option for a team environment
is to export the projects together. See <a href="../../com.ibm.etools.j2eeapp.doc/topics/tjsharingexport.html">Exporting projects for sharing</a>.</div>
<p>This
process for exporting an EJB project to a JAR file is not meant to be a project
sharing mechanism. If you want to share projects, see <a href="../../com.ibm.etools.j2eeapp.doc/topics/tjsharing.html">Sharing Projects</a>.</p>
<p>To export an EJB project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, right-click
the EJB module that you want to export.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Export</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">EJB
JAR file</span></span> from the pop-up menu. The Export wizard
opens.</span> <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>If this EJB project was previously imported, and there
is an <b>imported_classes</b> folder (or an <samp class="codeph">imported_classes.jar</samp> file
from an unmigrated project), these imported classes will be merged back into
the exported JAR file. All of the resources in the Java™ output folder ("bin") are included
in the EJB JAR.</div>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Destination</span> field, enter the full
path and JAR file name where you want to export the EJB module that is selected
in the <span class="uicontrol">EJB project</span> field.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>To export source files, select the <span class="uicontrol">Export
source files</span> check box.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>If you are exporting to an existing JAR file
and you do not want to be warned about overwriting it, select <span class="uicontrol">Overwrite
existing files without warning</span></span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"> <p>To deploy your EJB JAR file to an application server after you
export it, you need to use the deployment tools provided by the vendor of
that server.</p>
