<h1 class="topictitle1">Adding methods to the home interface</h1>
<div><p>You can use the Java™ editor to add a new home method.</p><div class="skipspace"> <p>Only BMP entity beans allow ejbFind methods to be promoted to
the home interface. Once promoted, the method name begins with "find" and
it throws the javax.ejb.FinderException and javax.ejb.RemoteException. Both
BMP and CMP beans allow ejbCreate&lt;METHOD&gt; methods to be promoted.
Once promoted, the method name is "create" and it throws the javax.ejb.CreateException
and the javax.ejb.RemoteException (javax.ejb.RemoteException is not added
for the local home interface). Also, comments for the methods in the bean
will be promoted as well (both to the home and remote interfaces). </p>
<p>To
add a new home method: </p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Open the Java editor in one of the following ways:</span><ul><li>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, right-click
the Java file
for the bean class that contains the method to be promoted, and select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Open with</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Java Editor</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, expand the EJB
module, then double-click the desired .java file.</li>
<li>On the Beans page of the deployment descriptor editor, in the Class
and Interface Files section, select the desired class and click <span class="uicontrol">Open</span>.
The class opens in the Java editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Type the method into the bean class.</span></li>
<li><span>Save your changes and close the editor.</span></li>
</ol>
