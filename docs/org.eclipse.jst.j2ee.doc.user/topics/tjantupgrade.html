<h1 class="topictitle1">Upgrading Ant</h1>
<div><p>Ant 1.6.1 is provided with this product. If you need
functionality from a different version of Ant, you can download and install
an updated version.</p>
<div class="section"> <div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="caution">If you change your Ant version, you have changed
your installation of the workbench, and it will no longer be a supported environment.
Although everything should still work as before, unexpected results may occur.
If you are familiar with developing plug-ins and understand how they are used
during startup, you can create a new plug-in directory with a higher version
number and a higher version number in its <samp class="codeph">plugin.xml</samp>, and
you can leave the existing directory as is.</div>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Go to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/binindex.html" target="_blank">Jakarta Apache</a> Web site and download
the Ant binary distribution that you want.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <samp class="codeph">org.eclipse.ant.core</samp> plugin directory (underneath
where you installed the workbench), rename the existing Ant JAR files and
drop in your new JAR files. If any JAR has a different name edit the <samp class="codeph">plugin.xml</samp> file
in <samp class="codeph">org.eclipse.ant.core</samp> accordingly.</span></li>
<li><span>Restart the workbench and your new version of Ant will be active.</span></li>
