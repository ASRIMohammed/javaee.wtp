h1 class="topictitle1">Project Explorer view in the J2EE perspective</h1>
<div><div>While developing J2EE applications in the J2EE perspective, the
Project Explorer view is your main view of your J2EE projects and resources.</div><p>The Project Explorer view provides an integrated view of all project resources,
including models of J2EE deployment descriptors, Javaâ„¢ artifacts, resources, Web services,
databases, and dynamic Web project artifacts.</p>
<p>You should use this view to work with your J2EE deployment descriptors
and their content. You can view an enterprise application project and see
all of the modules associated with it. </p>
<p>You can also filter what you see in the Project Explorer view to hide projects,
folders, or files that you don't want to see. To enable or disable filters,
click the <span class="uicontrol">Filters</span> button from the drop-down menu at
the top right corner of the view. For more information, see <a href="cjviewfilters.html" title="You can filter the Project Explorer view to hide projects, folders, or files that you don't want to see.">Filters
in the Project Explorer view</a>.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can filter what you see by showing or hiding working sets,
groups of related resources or projects. See <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cworkset.htm">Working Sets</a>.</p>
<p>The following image shows the Project Explorer view with a few projects:<br /><img src="../images/ProjectExplorer.gif" alt="Screen capture of the Project Explorer view" onload="javascript:resizeimage(this);" name="../images/ProjectExplorer.gif" /><br /></p>
