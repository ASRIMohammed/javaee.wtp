<h1 class="topictitle1">Working with a bean's client interface methods</h1>
<div><p>When you create an enterprise bean, a set of required methods for
the bean is automatically created. You can use the Java™ editor to modify methods.</p><div class="skipspace"><p>You can access the Java editor for the bean class from the
deployment descriptor editor. You can also edit them by double-clicking the
class in the Project Explorer view.</p>
<p>For CMP enterprise beans, you must
define all Find methods directly in the home interface and not promote them
from the enterprise bean class. Also, note that if you add or remove a home
or remote method after generating the deployment code, error symbols will
appear beside the enterprise bean and old generated code. You must regenerate
the deployment code.</p>
<p>In most cases, you can create all of your home
methods in exactly the same way. However, creating finder methods requires
some additional steps.</p>
<div class="p">The EJB label decorators on the methods will
not display unless you have the EJB Java Method Decorator selected in the Label
Decorations preferences page (<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Windows</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Workbench</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Label
Decorations</span></span>). This decorator adds a label for each
method that is promoted to a client interface. The decorator uses the following
labels:<ul><li><b>R</b>: remote interface</li>
<li><b>H</b>: home</li>
<li><b>LH</b>: local home</li>
<li><b>L</b>: local</li>
</ul>
