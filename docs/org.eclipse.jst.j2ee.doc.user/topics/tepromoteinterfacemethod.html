<h1 class="topictitle1">Promoting methods to an interface</h1>
<div><p>You can promote methods to the remote interface from an enterprise
bean class without editing the remote interface directly.</p><div class="p">In order to use this functionality, you must turn on the Advanced
J2EE capability in the workbench preferences (<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Workbench</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Capabilities</span></span>).</div>
<div class="skipspace"><p>When you create an enterprise bean, a set of required methods
for the bean is automatically created. You can modify these required methods
and add new remote (business) methods of your own.</p>
<p>After you create
these remote methods, you can promote the methods to the remote interface
from the enterprise bean class without editing the remote interface directly.
When exposing an API from the bean class to the remote interface, performance
needs to be considered. Several calls to methods on a remote object could
slow performance. In some cases, combining several operations into a single
batch method can improve performance.</p>
<p>Other method-level extensions
can be added on the Beans page of the deployment descriptor editor.</p>
<p>To
promote an existing method to an interface:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Open the Java™ editor in one of the following ways:</span><ul><li>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, select the Java file
for the bean class that contains the method to be promoted. Select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Open with</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Java Editor</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the Project Explorer view of the J2EE perspective, expand the ejbModule
folder and the package for your bean class, then double-click the .java file
for your bean class.</li>
<li>On the Beans page of the deployment descriptor editor, in the Class
and Interface Files section, select the desired class and click <span class="uicontrol">Open</span>.
The class opens in the Java editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Outline view of the J2EE perspective, right-click the business
method that you want to promote. On the pop-up menu, select one of
the following options, depending on which interfaces are available and the
type of bean that you are working with:</span><ul><li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Bean</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Promote
to Local Interface</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Bean</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Promote
to Local Home Interface</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Bean</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Promote
to Remote Interface</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Bean</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Promote
to Home Interface</span></span></li>
<li><span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Bean</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Promote
to Service Endpoint Interface</span></span></li>
</ul>
 If you promote to the remote interface, the generated promoted method
will throw the <samp class="codeph">javax.ejb.RemoteException</samp> exception. If the
remote interface is already opened in a Java editor, it will appear dirty, and
the Java editor
will not show up with an "R" next to the method in the outline view until
the editor holding the remote interface is saved.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Save your changes and close the editor.</span></li>
</ol>
